unix
====

**This repo describes tools, patterns, and workflows that make interaction with your computer more efficient.**

Almost every computer you'll interact with these days will be able to natively 'speak' with the UNIX utilities and bash workflows described here. It's the lingua franca of computers - understanding how to speak it will make your life better :)

@substack has done [a beautiful job](http://substack.net/many_things) describing why unix-flavored development is so powerful.

The first set of iterations will focus on small-scale, atomic tools. Later, we'll try to expand the same patterns to larger scales.
